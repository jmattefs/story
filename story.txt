Once upon a time there was a retired turtle detective that loved sandwiches.  He liked them so much that they were the only thing he ever ate.  Then one day, on a day like any other, every sandwich in the world disappeared all at once. This struck a chord with the turtle because he was also extremely stubborn and didn't want to eat something that wasn't a sandwich. This meant that he had to once again come out of retirement to solve the most important case of his life because this stubborn turtle detective's life truly depended on it.  This wasn't going to be easy for him either because of the fact that he was just a regular old turtle and not a teenage mutant ninja one that could walk upright.  If he were, there wouldn't be a story to tell because he would just be eating pizza all day, and solving The Case of the Disappeared Sandwiches would be a very low priority.  However, this was just a simple turtle with a knack for cracking cases. Being a disgraced former detective with many burned bridges along the way wasn't going to make this easy either.  Some basic detective work got him his first lead.  It was a name. The name of the last person to have seen a sandwich on Earth. It was a name he hadn't heard in over a decade, a name that belonged to his rabbit ex-partner, Deandre.
